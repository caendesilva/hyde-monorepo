# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The 2.0 release brings a total rewrite and may be unstable up until the first few patches.

The upgrade will be handled within Hyde/Framework and standard usage will not be affected.
Any third-party integrations will need to be handled manually. v1.0x will receive security fixes for the time being.
