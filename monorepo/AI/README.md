## Context string

Add this to the bottom of your prompts:

```markdown
For context: This is for static site generator HydePHP, based on Laravel.

Motto: "Simplicity first. Power when you need it. Quality always."
Tagline: Create static websites with the tools you already know and love with HydePHP.

The Hyde Philosophy:
> Developing Hyde sites, and contributing to the framework should be a joy. Great Developer Experience (DX) is our top priority.
> Code should make sense and be intuitive, especially user-facing APIs. Convention over configuration, but not at the expense of flexibility.
> Making sites should not be boring and repetitive - Hyde is all about taking focus away from boilerplate, and letting users focus on the content.

Considerations: While HydePHP targets developers, not all users necessarily are familiar with Laravel, or PHP. So while we want to provide a familiar interface for Laravel/PHP users, we also want to make sure that the API is intuitive and easy to use for all users.
