# Internal Code and Documentation Intelligence

This internal monorepo module contains tools to analyse the documentation and codebase to improve its quality.
All code here is internal and should not be used outside the monorepo and no support will be provided for it.

## Usage

As the resulting data models and dashboards can get quite large, they are excluded from the repository.
To generate them, run the following command:

```bash
php monorepo/CodeIntelligence/CodeIntelligence.php
```
