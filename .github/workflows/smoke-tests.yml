# This workflow is especially helpful for pull requests to quickly see if the other tests will definitely fail.
# In order to get even quicker feedback, we also ping our Continuous Integration server to get a status check
# as soon as we know the outcome, as the GitHub Actions Pull Request UI takes a little bit to update.
