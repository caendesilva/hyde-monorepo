**HydePHP consists of a few core components, the development of which is done in this monorepo.**

The code pushed here is automatically split into separate read-only repositories for each component.
The two most important components are **Hyde** and **Framework**. We also use **HydeFront** for frontend assets.

**The Hyde package is what the end-user sees and interacts with.** When creating a new HydePHP site, this is done using the Hyde project. The package contains all the necessary files to run a HydePHP site and bootstraps the entire system.

**The Framework package holds most of the logic of the Hyde framework.** This is where all the data models, static site generators, HydeCLI commands, Blade views, and more, are stored. Having this in a package makes it much easier to version and update using Composer.

**The HydeFront package contains stylesheets and scripts** to help make HydePHP sites accessible and interactive. It also includes a pre-compiled TailwindCSS file containing all the styles needed for the built-in Blade templates.

*The Hyde/Hyde project is stored in the monorepo root and works a bit differently from the others. Before pushing to the readonly repository, we apply persisted changes in the [`packages/hyde`](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/tree/master/packages/hyde) directory, then remove monorepo specific files.


### How the monorepo works

Changes to HydePHP including some first-party packages are made here. The changes are then pushed to the `develop` or `master` branches of the readonly repositories seen in the table above. These branches could be unstable.

This monorepo project is still new, and the internal structure of it may be changed without notice.


### Releases

While in the v0.x range, we consider both major and minor release versions to be the same. This means that when a new feature is added, it should be added as a minor version even if it is breaking. Patch versions should always be compatible. Once we reach v1.0 we will follow semantic versioning strictly.

The versioning between the Framework and Hyde packages are linked together Meaning that if Hyde get's a minor release, so must Framework, and vice versa. To make this easier, we also publish minor releases in the monorepo. Patch releases are not published in the monorepo, and are instead handled by the individual packages.
