## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### About

Keep an Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:

1. People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
2. At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.
