## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Note from the maintainer
First of all, I'm really sorry for the just insane amount of breaking changes in this update. I believe they are
necessary in order to make v1.0 a great and stable release. I hope you'll understand. Most of the changes
are likely to not affect normal usage, with the exception of the front matter navigation key changes.

### About

This release performs a large amount of refactors and naming changes in preparation for the 1.0 release. Many of these refactors are breaking as several classes are moved around to new namespaces, several are merged, methods renamed, interfaces updated, and more, so forth, etc.

In general, these changes should only affect those who have written custom code that interacts with the framework, though you may need to update your configuration files, and any Blade components you may have published.

#### What you can expect to break

The most high impact change is change of sidebar front matter options, and related areas. Please try updating your site in a test environment first, to see if you need to update any of your front matter.

### Added
- Added a JSON build information manifest automatically generated after a site build [#465](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/465)
- Added support for "dot notation" to the `HydePage::get()` method [#497](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/497)
- Added support for "dot notation" to route key retrievals in the `Route` facade [#513](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/513)
- Added a NavigationData object to HydePage.php
- Added a Route::is() method to determine if a given route or route key matches the instance it's called on
- Added a Site model [#506](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/506)
- Added a route:list command [#516](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/516)

### Changed

#### Major breaking changes

**A very large number the changes in this update are breaking**, as such, not all are marked as breaking. The really major changes that require especially close attention are here listed, please scroll down to see the rest as well as the concrete changes of this high level overview.

- Renamed base class AbstractPage to HydePage
- Renamed base class AbstractMarkdownPage to BaseMarkdownPage
- Renamed several HydePage methods to be more consistent
- Renamed property $title to $label in NavItem.php
- Renamed property $uri to $url in Image.php
- Removed both RouteContract interfaces (inlined into Route.php, which you now type hint against instead)
- Changed front matter key `navigation.title` to `navigation.label`
- Changed front matter key `image.uri` to `image.url` for blog posts

##### Navigation schema changes
If you are using any of the following front matter properties, you will likely need to update them:

- `navigation.title` is now `navigation.label`
- The `label` setting has been removed from documentation pages, use `navigation.label` instead 
- The `hidden` setting has been removed from documentation pages, use `navigation.hidden` instead 
- The `priority` setting has been removed from documentation pages, use `navigation.priority` instead 

This change also bubbles to the HydePage accessors, though that will only affect you if you have written or published custom code that interacts with the framework.

#### General

- Merged interface PageContract into abstract class AbstractPage
- Merged interface RouteFacadeContract into the Route model implementation
- Merged interface RouteContract into the Route model implementation
- Merged `getCurrentPagePath()` method into existing `getRouteKey()` method in PageContract and AbstractPage
- Replaced schema traits with interfaces, see https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/485
- Extracted all constructor methods in page schema traits to a new single trait ConstructPageSchemas
- The `StaticPageBuilder::$outputPath` property is now a relative path instead of absolute
- Refactored how navigation and sidebar data are handled, unifying the API, see below for more details
- The algorithm for finding the navigation and sidebar orders has been updated, this may affect the order of your pages, and may require you to re-tweak any custom priorities.
- The navigation link to documentation index page now has default priority 500 instead of 100
- All usages where the RouteContract was type hinted with have been updated to type hint against the Route model implementation instead
- Changed Blade component identifier class 'sidebar-category' to 'sidebar-group'
- Changed Blade component identifier class 'sidebar-category-heading' to 'sidebar-group-heading'
- Changed Blade component identifier class 'sidebar-category-list' to 'sidebar-group-list'
- Changed the Route::toArray schema 
- Split the page metadata handling so that global metadata is now handled by the Site model (meta.blade.php must be updated if you have published it)
- The MetadataBag class now implements Htmlable, so you can use it directly in Blade templates without calling `render()`
- internal: Move responsibility for filtering documentation pages to the navigation menus (this means that documentation pages that are not 'index' are no longer regarded as hidden)
- internal: The HydePage::$navigation property is now a NavigationData object instead of an array, however the object extends ArrayObject, so it should be mostly compatible with existing code

#### Class and method renames
- Renamed base class AbstractPage to HydePage
- Renamed base class AbstractMarkdownPage to BaseMarkdownPage
- Renamed command class HydeBuildStaticSiteCommand to HydeBuildSiteCommand
- Renamed legacy class FileCacheService to ViewDiffService
