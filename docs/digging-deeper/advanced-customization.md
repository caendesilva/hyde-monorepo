# Advanced Customization

## Introduction & Warning

>danger Danger lies ahead! Read this before you proceed.

This page covers advanced usage of potentially experimental and unstable features and is intended for developers
who know what they are doing and can handle the risk of breaking things. The article will also cover things
that you _can_ do, but that you maybe should not. With great power comes great responsibility. You have been warned.

Documentation here will be mainly example driven, as it is assumed you have somewhat of an understanding of what you are doing already.

### Emoji legend

Each section is marked with an emoji that indicates the level of risk. Note that pretty much all of these
are experimental features, and are not at all supported. Use at your own risk.

- ðŸ§ª = Indicates experimental features bound to change at any time.
- âš  = Exercise caution when using this feature.
- ðŸ’” = This could seriously break things


## Prerequisites for Customizing directories

>info Before customizing source and output directories it may be helpful to know how these settings are stored internally.

**The following is a summary from the [Page Models](page-models) documentation:**

Each page type is represented by a page model class. Each of those classes have static properties that store the source and output directories.
These properties are set when the [`HydeServiceProvider`](https://github.com/hydephp/framework/blob/master/src/Framework/HydeServiceProvider.php)
is registered, at which point the provider will search for any overrides in the config file.

**This means that there are two options to change the source and output directories:**
1. **Recommended:** You can change the values in the config file, to let the `HydeServiceProvider` handle it for you.
2. **Advanced/Overkill:** You can also set the static properties directly in the page model classes if you prefer.
   - You'd probably want to do this in a service provider, as it must be done before the Kernel is booted.
   - You can use the [`RegistersFileLocations`](https://github.com/hydephp/framework/blob/master/src/Framework/Concerns/RegistersFileLocations.php)
     trait to use the same registration logic as the `HydeServiceProvider`.


## Customizing source directories

The directories you place your content in are important. The directory will be used to determine the proper page type and the templates used.
If you are not happy with defaults, you can change them. Note that these are relative to the `source_root` setting,
which is the root of your project by default.

Note that you need to take care of conflicts when changing the source directories. For example, if you store Markdown
posts in the same directory as documentation pages, Hyde will not know which page type to use.

### In the config file

```php
// filepath config/hyde.php

'source_directories' => [
    HtmlPage::class => '_pages',
    BladePage::class => '_pages',
    MarkdownPage::class => '_pages',
    MarkdownPost::class => '_posts',
    DocumentationPage::class => '_docs',
],
```

### In a service provider

```php
// filepath app/AppServiceProvider.php
use Hyde\Framework\Concerns\RegistersFileLocations;

public function register(): void
{
    $this->registerSourceDirectories([
        HtmlPage::class => '_pages',
        BladePage::class => '_pages',
        MarkdownPage::class => '_pages',
        MarkdownPost::class => '_posts',
        DocumentationPage::class => '_docs',
    ]);
}
```


## Custom source root directory

HydePHP will by default look for the source directories shown above in the root of your project.
If you're not happy with this, it's easy to change! For example, you might want everything in a `'src'` subdirectory.
That's easy enough, just set the value of the `source_root` setting in `config/hyde.php` to `'src'`, or whatever you prefer!

```php
// filepath config/hyde.php

'source_root' => '', // [TL! --]
'source_root' => 'src', // [TL! ++]
```

### Automatic change

You can even make this change automatically with the `php hyde change:sourceDirectory` command!

```bash
php hyde change:sourceDirectory <name>
```

When run, Hyde will update the source directory setting in the config file, then create the directory if it doesn't exist,
and move all source directories and their content into it.


## Custom media directory

The media directory houses assets like images and stylesheets. The default directory is `_media`, and upon building the site,
Hyde will copy all files in this directory to `_site/media` (or whatever your configured output and media directories are).

You can change the path to this directory by setting the `media_directory` option in `config/hyde.php`.

```php
// filepath config/hyde.php
'media_directory' => '_media',
```

#### Setting changes both source and output directories

Note that this change will affect both the source and output directories. For example, if you set the value to `assets`,
all files from `assets` will be copied to `_site/assets`. If the setting starts with an underscore, that will be removed
from the output directory, so files in `_assets` will be copied to `_site/assets`.

>info Note that you will likely need to manually update `webpack.mix.js` so Laravel Mix can compile the assets correctly.

>info You will of course also need to copy over any existing files from the old directory to the new one.


## Customizing the output directory âš 

>danger Hyde deletes all files in the output directory before compiling the site. Don't set this path to a directory that contains important files!

If you want to store your compiled website in a different directory than
the default `_pages`, you can change the path using the following configuration option in config/hyde.php. The path is expected to be relative to your project root.

```php
// filepath config/hyde.php
return [
    'output_directory' => 'docs',
];
```
