# Helpers and Utilities

## Introduction

HydePHP comes with a few helper classes and utilities to make your life easier. This page will cover some of the most important ones.

### File-based Collections

Hyde provides `DataCollections`, a subset of [Laravel Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/collections) giving you a similar developer experience to working with Eloquent Collections. However, instead of accessing a database,
it's all entirely file-based using static data files such as Markdown, Yaml, and JSON files which get parsed into objects that you can easily work with.

See the [File-based Collections](collections) documentation for more information.
