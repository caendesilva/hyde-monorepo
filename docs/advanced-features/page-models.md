# The Hyde Page Models

## Introduction

The Hyde page models are an integral part of how HydePHP creates your static site. Each page in your site is represented
by a page model. These are simply PHP classes that in addition to holding both the source content and computed data
for your pages, also houses instructions to Hyde on how to parse, process, and render the pages to static HTML.

In this article, you'll get a high-level overview of the page models, and some code examples to give you a look inside.
