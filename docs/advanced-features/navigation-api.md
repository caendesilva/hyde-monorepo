# Navigation API

>warning This article covers advanced information that is only relevant if you want to create custom navigation menus. Instead, you may want to read the [Navigation](navigation) article for a general overview.

## Abstract

This article describes the Navigation API introduced in HydePHP v2. Both the main navigation menu and the documentation sidebar bundled with HydePHP are built with this API.
However, if you are interested in creating your own custom navigation menus, you can also utilize this API - and this article will show you how.

This article is intended for advanced users, as most users will not need to create custom navigation menus.
For this reason, the documentation is very code-driven due to the technical nature of the API.
